# JKL Site Linker

JKL Site Linker allows you to add a list of URLs to a Page and have them display as thumbnail links.

Ideally, you input a series of links, and when they are output to the page, the script grabs a screenshot and the Site Title and displays them - either in a list, or as "cards."

You should be able to enter affiliate links as well and have them generate a regular screenshot of the website.
